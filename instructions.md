# Substitution

For this problem, you’ll write a program that implements a substitution cipher, per the below.

```
key: JTREKYAVOGDXPSNCUIZLFBMWHQ
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: VKXXN
```

## Background

In a substitution cipher, we “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) a message by replacing every letter with another letter. To do so, we use a key: in this case, a mapping of each of the letters of the alphabet to the letter it should correspond to when we encrypt it. To “decrypt” the message, the receiver of the message would need to know the key, so that they can reverse the process: translating the encrypt text (generally called ciphertext) back into the original message (generally called plaintext).

A key, for example, might be the string `NQXPOMAFTRHLZGECYJIUWSKDVB`. This 26-character key means that `A` (the first letter of the alphabet) should be converted into `N` (the first character of the key), `B` (the second letter of the alphabet) should be converted into `Q` (the second character of the key), and so forth.

A message like `HELLO`, then, would be encrypted as `FOLLE`, replacing each of the letters according to the mapping determined by the key.

Let’s write a program called substitution that enables you to encrypt messages using a substitution cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by providing a command-line argument, on what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at runtime.

Here are a few examples of how the program might work. For example, if the user inputs a key of `YTNSHKVEFXRBAUQZCLWDMIPGJO` and a plaintext of `HELLO`:

```
key: YTNSHKVEFXRBAUQZCLWDMIPGJO
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: EHBBQ
```

Here’s how the program might work if the user provides a key of `VCHPRZGJNTLSKFBDQWAXEUYMOI` and a plaintext of `hello, world`:

```
key: VCHPRZGJNTLSKFBDQWAXEUYMOI
plaintext:  hello, world
ciphertext: jrssb, ybwsp
```

Notice that neither the comma nor the space were substituted by the cipher. Only substitute alphabetical characters! Notice, too, that the case of the original message has been preserved. Lowercase letters remain lowercase, and uppercase letters remain uppercase.

Whether the characters in the key itself are uppercase or lowercase doesn’t matter. A key of `VCHPRZGJNTLSKFBDQWAXEUYMOI` is functionally identical to a key of `vchprzgjntlskfbdqwaxeuymoi` (as is, for that matter, `VcHpRzGjNtLsKfBdQwAxEuYmOi`).

And what if a user doesn’t provide a valid key? The program should explain with an error message:

```
key: ABC
Key must contain 26 characters.
```

Or really doesn’t cooperate, providing no command-line argument at all? The program should remind the user how to use the program:

```
key: 
Key must contain 26 characters.
```

## Specifications

Design and implement a program, substitution, that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher.

* Implement your program in `Main.java`.
* Your program must accept a single command-line argument, the key to use for the substitution. The key itself should be case-insensitive, so whether any character in the key is uppercase or lowercase should not affect the behavior of your program.
* If your program is executed without any command-line arguments or with more than one command-line argument, your program should print the error message `Key must be one continuous string of 26 unique alphabetic characters.` and return `1` from `main`.
* If the key is invalid (i.e., if is does not contain 26 characters, contains any character that is not an alphabetic character, or contains the same letter more than once), your program should print the error message `Key must be one continuous string of 26 unique alphabetic characters.` and return `1` from `main`.
* Your program must output `plaintext:  ` (with two spaces but without a newline) and then prompt the user for a string of plaintext (using `Scanner`).
* Your program must output `ciphertext: ` (with one space but without a newline) followed by the plaintext’s corresponding ciphertext, with each alphabetical character in the plaintext substituted for the corresponding character in the ciphertext; non-alphabetical characters should be outputted unchanged.
* Your program must preserve case: capitalized letters must remain capitalized letters; lowercase letters must remain lowercase letters.
* After outputting ciphertext, you should print a newline. Your program should then exit by returning `0` from `main`.
